# battleship_project
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process. 
- ***Pseudo-coding was really important for us to brainstorm and come up with methods to write. Utilized Rocks and mentors to get the ball rolling and build the framework.***
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on? 
- ***I (Nathan) wanted to find a way to add music, and Logan would like to refactor some of the methods and make the NPC more intelligent. It would also be nice to make the board larger.***
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project. 
- ***Initially ping-ponging and then we switched to driver/navigator when things got more complicated.***
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. 
- ***We discussed immediately how we were feeling about the style of work, and adjusted to each other's schedules as well.***
